# Supply Chain Optimization Project (R)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **streamlining logistics processes, reducing costs, and minimizing delivery delays** while maintaining customer satisfaction. Using historical supply chain and logistics data, we provide actionable insights to optimize inventory, shipping routes, and supplier performance.

## Project Objectives
The main goals are to:

1. Identify which **vendors and shipping routes** are most responsible for delivery delays.  
2. Determine how **holding costs** can be reduced while maintaining demand by optimizing inventory levels.  
3. Estimate potential **cost savings** from optimized shipping routes and warehouse placement.  
4. Analyze **geographic variations** in supplier reliability and use this information to improve supply chain performance.  
5. Evaluate whether **machine learning models** can forecast delivery delays or inventory shortages using past trends and current data.  

## Methods
The project uses the following techniques in R:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `data.table` to examine trends in inventory turnover, delivery delays, and costs.  
2. **Clustering Analysis:** Group suppliers and routes with `kmeans` or hierarchical clustering based on delivery times, pricing, and reliability.  
3. **Optimization Modeling:** Use linear programming with the `lpSolve` or `ROI` package to determine **ideal inventory levels and shipment plans**.  
4. **Forecasting/ML Models:** Implement predictive models using `caret` or `randomForest` to forecast possible delays or inventory shortages.

## Impact
This project demonstrates advanced **data-driven supply chain analytics**. Businesses can benefit from:

- Increased customer satisfaction  
- Reduced operational costs  
- Improved supply chain efficiency  

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive **report** with findings and insights  
- **R scripts** for EDA, clustering, optimization, and forecasting  

## R Packages Used
- `dplyr`, `data.table`, `ggplot2` (data manipulation and visualization)  
- `kmeans`, `stats` (clustering analysis)  
- `lpSolve`, `ROI` (optimization modeling)  
- `caret`, `randomForest` (predictive modeling)
